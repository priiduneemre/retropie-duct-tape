# retropie-duct-tape

Handy shell scripts for adding extra features to any RetroPie installation, such as:

* Graceful power scripts for custom ES boot system (shutdown, restart & exit to terminal);
* Standalone splashscreens and screensavers (via `ffplay`, `mpv` or `vlc`).
 
Additionally, there are a bunch of CLI tools for automating tedious manual work.
